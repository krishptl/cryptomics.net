          <h2>The problem</h2>
          <p>
            Genomic data powers precision medicine, drug discovery, risk prediction, consumer genomics, and forensics. At the same time, genomes are uniquely
            identifying and effectively immutable once exposed, harm cannot be undone and re-identification risk only grows.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Locked away or overexposed</h3>
            <p>
              Today, institutions face a false choice. Genomic data is either locked down, slowing research and clinical progress, or broadly shared,
              creating high risk of re-identification, discrimination, and misuse.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Monolithic files, blunt access</h3>
            <p>
              Existing security models treat genomes as monolithic files (VCF, BAM, FASTA) with all-or-nothing access. They ignore region-level risk
              (e.g., BRCA1 vs. neutral regions) and lack role-, purpose-, and time-bounded controls.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Policy on paper, not in code</h3>
            <p>
              HIPAA, GDPR, IRB, and consent forms live on paper or in PDFs. Enforcement is manual and after the fact, rather than encoded directly
              into how keys are issued and data is accessed.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Security that users work around</h3>
            <p>
              Crypto, key management, and file formats are invisible, brittle, or bolted on. Analysts, clinicians, and investigators work around
              security controls to get their job done, eroding trust for participants and regulators.

          <h2>Our approach</h2>
          <p>
            Cryptomics combines modern cryptography, fine-grained data architecture, and machine-enforceable policy to make region-level access control
            feel like a normal analysis workflow.
